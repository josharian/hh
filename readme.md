WARNING: Package hh is experimental while I tinker with the API.

Package hh contains HTTP handler helpers.

```sh
go get github.com/josharian/hh
```

Discussion below. But most people just want examples, so...

# Examples

Basic mux setup. Note that you can mix-and-match wrapped and unwrapped handlers.

```go
mux := hh.WrapMux(http.NewServeMux())
mux.HandleFunc("GET /{$}", srv.handleRoot) // normal stdlib handler
mux.HandleWrap("GET /thing/{id}", srv.handleThing) // wrapped handler
```

Basic handler usage, showing off lots of different error return options.

```go
func (s *HTTPServer) handleThing(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) error {
    // This is toy code. Don't nitpick or copy unthinkingly, please!
    id := r.PathValue("id")
    thing, err := s.DB.LookUpThing(id)
    if errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows) {
        return hh.E404() // 404, standard text
    }
    if err != nil {
        return err // 500, standard text
    }
    authorized := s.checkAuth(r, thing)
    if !authorized {
        return hh.S401("no thing for you") // 401, custom text
    }
    if msg := thing.isBroken(); msg != nil {
        return hh.F403("this this is temporarily broken: %v", msg)
    }
    nextAllowedRequest := ratelimitDelay(r)
    if delay := nextAllowedRequest.Sub(time.Now()); delay > 0 {
        info := map[string]float64{"sleep_sec": delay.Seconds()}
        return hh.J429(info) // 429, JSON-encoded object
    }
    return json.NewEncoder(w).Write(thing)
}
```

Adding in errorware:

```go
func slogHTTPErrors(r *http.Request, err error) error {
	if err == nil {
		slog.DebugContext(r.Context(), "http request", "method", r.Method, "url", r.URL.String())
	} else {
		slog.ErrorContext(r.Context(), "http request failed", "method", r.Method, "url", r.URL.String(), "err", err)
	}
	return err
}

// All wrapped HTTP handlers will have their errors (nil or otherwise!) passed through slogHTTPErrors.
mux := hh.WrapMux(http.NewServeMux(), slogHTTPErrors)
```

Use for a single handler, without touching the mux:

```go
subrouter.HandleFunc("/foo", hh.Wrap(srv.handleFoo)) // can also pass errorware to Wrap
```


# What is it

## Goals

The primary goal is to make it easy to write HTTP handlers that return errors. That helps avoid this dreaded mistake:

```go
authorized := checkAuth(r)
if !authorized {
	http.Error(w, "unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
}
// do sensitive stuff
```

The secondary goals are minimality, compositionality, and "batteries included" APIs for core, common functionality.

## Non-goals

Anything that can be left out! This includes middleware, improved routing, etc.

It is easy to add APIs later, but painful to remove them.

If there's clear consensus on common errorware, they might be a candidate.

## Approach

There are three parts to the package.

1. Adapters for HTTP handlers that return errors.
2. Special errors to trigger common HTTP responses.
3. Hooks for "errorware": Inspecting and modifying errors on the way out.

These are all fundamentally interwoven, which is why they're all lumped together in one package.

The adapters are `func Wrap`, which is the core low level adapter, and `type Mux`, which lets you avoid writing out `hh.Wrap` repeatedly, particularly when you're re-using a standard suite of errorware.

The core special error is `*Error`, which gives total control over the HTTP response. There are autogenerated helpers for standard 2xx, 4xx, and 5xx HTTP error codes.

* The Ennn APIs respond with the default text.
* The Snnn APIs respond with fixed text.
* The Fnnn APIs respond with fmt.Sprintf-formatted text.
* The Jnnn APIs respond with JSON-encoded information.

Strings created by calling `Error()` on errors in this package are designed for internal logging, and may contain more information than what `Wrap` sends to the client.

Both `Wrap` and `Mux` support integrated errorware, which is a way to log, inspect, and replace errors after the HTTP handler has finished processing.
